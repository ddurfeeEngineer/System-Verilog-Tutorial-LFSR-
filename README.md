This file is an example piece of system verilog that implements a real linear feedback shift register but with 
comments that help you understand what sections should exist and what should be in them.
While there is alot of information on the internet for how to use system verilog, there were so few examples 
of how to code something real in system verilog so I thought I'd write one that is not covered under some NDA.
